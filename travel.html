                        <p>Jungfrau is a city in Switzerland known for its mountain summits nicknamed the “top of Europe.” It is very famous also for its railway created in 1912 that can bring you to a height of 3454m. At the summit there are outstanding views where you can see the whole city and beyond.</p>
                        <p>The scenery consists of valleys, waterfalls, rock walls, and snow peaks. When visiting, it is vital to go on a day with good weather because it enhances the quality of the views. Hiking is very popular at short trails called Grutschalp and Murren. A very common tourist attraction is also exploring the Lauterbrunnen valley.

                        <p>Even though diamonds are Botswana’s largest export, its true jewel is the wildlife in it. All the big five game animals are present in the Okavango Delta. It also holds one of the world’s largest animal populations, including elephants, lions, cheetahs, and more.</p>
                        <p>The Okavango Delta is in the middle of a desert, making it one of the few deltas that stand out from the other ~10000 deltas. Oil deposits were recently discovered in the rock in the Delta. This is a possible threat as extraction companies may pollute the water bodies, risking the lives of over 500 species of animals.</p>

                        <p>Spirit island, located in the heart of Maligne Lake, Jasper was a spiritual place of healing for the rocky mountain tribe for over 2000 years before they were displaced in the 1900s. They believed that each mountain with a face in the hall of the gods(the mountains in front of spirit island) contains the essence of each god of each religion as well as all notable rocky mountain tribesmen.</p>
                        <p>In 2020, there was a forest fire in a nearby forest region of Lake Maligne. Because of that forest fire, the few remaining tribe members from that same rocky mountain tribe approached the Canadian government to get access to Spirit Island away since they believe that the forest fire was a punishment by their gods for being away from their spiritual home for so long. Now, the rocky mountain tribe works with the Canadian government to perform their spiritual healing once a year.</p>

It is renowned for its breathtaking beauty, architectural ingenuity, and historical significance. Believed to have been built in the 15th century during the height of the Inca Empire, Machu Picchu served as a royal estate or religious retreat for the Incan ruler Pachacuti.</p>
                        <p>Machu Picchu's remote location and mysterious abandonment in the decades following its construction have contributed to its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The site is characterized by its well-preserved stone structures, including temples, plazas, residential buildings, and intricate terraces carved into the mountainside. The precise construction methods used to build Machu Picchu without the use of mortar have puzzled archaeologists for decades. The entire complex is surrounded by stunning panoramic views of the surrounding valleys and mountains.</p>
